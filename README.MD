# Testing Git Repository

This repository was created solely for personal testing purposes. I am using it to familiarize myself with Git and GitHub, and to explore version control workflows. The content here is not intended for any production or real-world use.

## Purpose

- To test Git commands and workflows.
- To learn about version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.
- To experiment with branching, merging, and pull requests.

Feel free to explore, but please note that this repository does not serve any other purpose beyond testing.

## Notes

- The repository contains practice work and may include experimental changes.
- Changes here are for educational and self-testing purposes.

Thank you for visiting!
